            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>⅓ cup bulk pork sausage</li>
            <li>1 (3.5 ounce) link bulk Italian sausage</li>
            <li>½ cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>⅓ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>24 slices pepperoni</li>
            <li>⅓ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened (Optional)</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon Italian seasoning (Optional)</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h2>Directions</h2></p>
        <p><h4>Step 1</h4></p>
        <p>
            Sprinkle yeast and brown sugar over warm water in the bowl
             of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Let stand 5 to 10 minutes 
             until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.
        </p>
        <p><h4>Step 2</h4></p>
        <p>
            Turn mixer to the lowest setting and slowly add 2 cups flour 1/2 cup at a time. 
            Add garlic salt and 1/4 cup butter. Integrate remaining 2 cups flour and knead until 
            dough is smooth and elastic, 5 to 7 minutes.
        </p>
        <p><h4>Step 3</h4></p>
        <p>
            Coat a large glass bowl with 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil. Shape dough into a ball and place 
            in bowl, turning to coat all sides with oil. Spray a piece of plastic wrap with cooking spray 
            and loosely cover bowl. Cover bowl with a towel and let rise in a warm area until dough 
            has doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Punch down dough and allow to rest for 20 minutes.
        </p>
        <p><h4>Step 4</h4></p>
        <p>
            While dough is resting, heat a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bulk sausage until 
            browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Transfer cooked sausage to a bowl with a slotted spoon, 
            retaining drippings in the skillet. Fry Italian sausage link in drippings until browned and no 
            longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Slice sausage. 
        </p>
        <p><h4>Step 5</h4></p>
        <p>
            Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-inch cast iron skillet with 2 tablespoons 
            grapeseed oil.
        </p>
        <p><h4>Step 6</h4></p>
        <p>
            Press dough into and up the sides of the prepared skillet. Poke holes in dough with a fork to prevent air bubbles. 
            Spread pizza sauce around the base of the crust. Sprinkle 1/3 cup mozzarella cheese over sauce; layer half 
            the bulk sausage, half the sliced sausage, and half the pepperoni over cheese. Repeat the layers of meat. 
            Top with remaining 1/3 cup mozzarella cheese.
        </p>
        <p><h4>Step 7</h4></p>
        <p>
            Bake in preheated oven on the bottom rack until crust is golden brown, about 25 minutes. 
            Brush crust with 1 tablespoon butter; season with Italian seasoning and garlic powder. 
            Remove pizza from skillet and let rest for 3 to 5 minutes before slicing.
